Parsemat v. 0.9 Beta is a tool for compositional or analytical tasks of Particular Analysis. 
Analysis. It is a program aimed at composers, researchers in music, mainly texture and form, and those interested in understanding Particular Analysis and its derived theories. Its applications include:

- Formal and textural analysis;
- Identification of copyright traits common to the repertoires of one or more composers;
- Comparison with other types of analysis (harmonic, rhythmic) to deduce structural relationships;
- Analysis of orchestration and distribution of instruments;
- Analysis of melodic structures.

Version 0.9 Beta is in the testing phase, and we offer it as an open-source program.
